First of all I would like to thank my family, my brother and specially my parents for all their efford by which I am here today, and for supporting all my decisions during all of these years.\\

I would also like to thank my old teachers Juan and Alberto, for introducing me in the world of robotics and 3D printing, and turning me a self-taught person, no longer waiting for someone to teach me something I want to learn.\\

To the people in Samsamia and the Robotics Society, for teaching me a lot of things along this year that have help me a lot with the development of this work.\\

And last but no least, I would like to thank my classmates David, Irene and Elena not only for all the labs, reports and works we have suffered together, but also for all the good times we have spent during these four long years that now have come to an end.\\
